The `ps4` platform allows you to control a [Playstation 4](https://www.playstation.com/da-dk/explore/ps4/) using the Playstation App via [PS4-Waker](https://github.com/dhleong/ps4-waker).

### {% linkable_title Setup %}

To begin you need to download the [Playstation App](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/ps4/app/) and install [PS4-Waker](https://github.com/dhleong/ps4-waker) locally to generate the credentials.

To generate the credentials follow these steps :

* Install nodejs
* Install ps4-waker
* Download the Playstation app so you can setup a remote device
* Start the pairing process ps4-waker -c .ps4-wake.credentials.json -d 10.0.0.4
* Test that ps4-waker -c .ps4-wake.credentials.json -d 10.0.0.4 search works
* Copy the content of the .ps4-wake.credentials.json file


### {% linkable_title Configuration %}

To add a PS4 to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: ps4
    host: 10.0.0.4
```

Configuration variables:

- **host** (*Required*): The IP of the PS4, e.g. `10.0.0.4`.
- **name** (*Optional*): Device name (Default: Playstation 4).
- **filename** (*Optional*): The filename where the credentials for the PS4 should be stored. This path is relative to Home Assistant's config directory. It defaults to `ps4.conf`.
- **credentials_filename** (*Optional*): Credentials filename from ps4-waker.
- **games_filename** (*Optional*): Games json file, data file containing the games started on your Playstation (Default: ps4-games.json)
- local_store: local www folder to use for locally saved images. Load images from local www dir. Naming convention for images is www/{local_store folder}/{titleid}.jpg (Default: games)

A full configuration example will look like the sample below:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: ps4
    host: 10.0.0.4
    name: PS4
    filename: ps4.conf
    credentials_filename: .ps4-wake.credentials.json
    games_filename: ps4-games.json
    local_store: games
```

### games json file example
The json games file is automaticly written and updates every time you start a game, but if you need to edit it manually the format is :
```json
{
  "CUSA02491": "Mass Effect\u2122",
  "CUSA01116": "YouTube",
  "CUSA01262": "Tom Clancy's The Division\u2122",
  "CUSA01703": "Plex"
}
```
